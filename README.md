lockfree-cpp
============

Some lock-free datastructures and tools in C++ that do not require C++11.

The datastructures themselves are header-only; you'll need pthreads to comple
the unit tests.

Thanks to [Phil Nash](http://www.levelofindirection.com/about-me/) for his 
[Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit test framework.
